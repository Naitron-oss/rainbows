# Rainbow Island Game

## Description

Here you can find the first project I developed at Ironhack. It is an HTML5 Canvas Game based in a 1987 arcade game named *Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2.*
It is a vertical platform game. The player jumps over the platforms and can shoot rainbows that kill the enemies as well as help him to reach some difficult tiles. In his way, the player will find coins that give him points and a power-up (a gemm) that can gives him superpowers!
