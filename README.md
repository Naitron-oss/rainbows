# Rainbow Island Game


Here you can find the first project I developed at Ironhack. It is an HTML5 Canvas Game based in a 1987 arcade game named *Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2.*


## Features
 - As a player you can run, jump and shoot rainbows.
 - Rainbows can kill enemies as well as help you to reach some difficult tiles. 
 - You can get coins on your way that add points to your score.
 - You can get a power-up when you find a gemm. It gives the player superpowers (such as more powerful rainbows that are shooted both sides).
 
## Technologies

- HTML5 Canvas
- Javascript (ES6)
- Bootstrap
- CSS3

## Run in local

You open the game just by opening the index.html in your browser.
